End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline with Azure
Overview
This project demonstrates the design, development, and deployment of a robust data engineering pipeline using Azure cloud services. It integrates data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analytics to provide a seamless solution for processing large datasets.

Objective
To build a scalable, reliable, and automated data pipeline that processes real-time and batch data efficiently, ensuring data quality, consistency, and actionable insights.

Detailed Description
Data Sources

Data is collected from diverse sources, including structured databases, APIs, and streaming data.
Data Ingestion

Azure Data Factory is used to extract data from multiple sources and integrate it into a centralized data repository.
Data Transformation

ETL pipelines clean, transform, and prepare the data for downstream analytics, ensuring high data quality and consistency.
Data Storage

Delta Lake is employed for efficient storage, supporting both batch and streaming data with ACID transactions.
Data Processing and Analytics

Azure Databricks, powered by Apache Spark, processes data for real-time and batch analytics. Complex business intelligence workflows are implemented here.
Data Visualization

Insights derived from the processed data are visualized through dashboards and reports, driving informed decision-making.
